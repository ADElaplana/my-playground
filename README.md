# my-playground

**Monorepo for Personal Code Experiments**

A sandbox repository where I explore how things work and improve my coding skills. Each folder is a small experimentâ€”games in Pygame, data-processing scripts, web scrapers, algorithm demos, and more. I'm ready to apply these learnings to bigger projects that come along. Feel free to browse, star, or fork anything that catches your eye!
